# Tourist Scheduler

This project combines different existing sources of data related to events and points of interest (PoIs) in the city of Stockholm. The system generates a schedule to explore the PoIs that the users select based on their visit times, budget constraints, and type of transport. The front-end thus consists of a mobile application that shows a map of Stockholm and allows the users to enter information about their respective trips. These parameters are later used to generate a schedule based on the opening times of the PoIs, the traffic situation and other criteria.
